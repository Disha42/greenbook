## Developer notes:
The app is built with React + NextJS and is hosted/deployed on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) (formerly now.sh)

We use [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for the icons at the moment. Look at components/Icons.js to see how to add each individually needed Icon

We *do not* currently use any UI frameworks. Simply coded css and react is it for now.

## How to get started coding on this app
```sh
    # clone the repo
    git clone git@github.com:pleaseshutup/greenbook.git

    # change your directory into the greenbook repo
    cd greenbook

    # install node modules
    npm install

    # run the dev server
    # this should make http://localhost:3000 available in your web browser
    npm run dev

```
